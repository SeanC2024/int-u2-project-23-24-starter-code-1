    <h1>Phoenix Arizona</h1>
    
    Phoenix is a large city located in the Southern middle of Arizona in Maricopa County. 
Phoenix has a population of 1.6 million as of 2021
Utilizes natural gas as its primary energy source with nuclear energy as its second most produced resource.

    <h1>Pollution Problems</h1>
    Phoenix struggles with with high particulate levels in the air.
Increased levels of CO3 production at ground level (Ground Level ozone).
Airborne toxins that cause cancer and respiratory issues are prominent in Phoenix
These issues are a byproduct of mass manufacturing in Phoenix.

    The S.N.O.R.E method; 
    S-Solar 
    N-Nuclear 
    O-Optimization 
    R-Reduced 
    E-Emissions
    Arizona has the second highest solar energy potential per state and has the largest nuclear power plant in the nation. 
I propose that renewable energy sources such as wind and solar energy alongside nuclear energy are subsidized. 
CO2 emission cost increased 
Energy efficient transportation and buildings/ industries would be subsidized.
Methane emissions would be reduced via tax
New Zero Carbon research would become a key focus for research
Afforestation would increase with deforestation decreasing
